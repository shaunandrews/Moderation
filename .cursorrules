When adding a new component always create a new folder in the /src/components directory.

Every component folder should have a README.md file that describes the component and its usage.

When editing an existing component, update the README.md file to reflect the changes. If one doesn't exist, create it.

When writing CSS always reference /src/colors.css and /src/typography.css for color and typography variables.

Ask before adding new CSS variables.
